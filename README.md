# Radar-Timing-Tester RTT
This is a very simple tool that lets you draw on a CSGO radar image to get a mostly accurate idea of how long it would take to walk there. Currently it assumes with a knife, however this could be changed to allow any weapon type in the future.

This is currently an early build. If you have comments or suggestions I am open to adding features as required.
